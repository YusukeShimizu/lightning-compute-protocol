# AGENTS

Repository-wide agent guidance is centralized as repo-local Codex skills under `.codex/skills/`.

Use `/skills` to browse, or invoke explicitly by name (example: `$lcp-repo`).

- Start here: `$lcp-repo`
- Complex feature / significant refactor: `$lcp-execplan`

If you are editing files under a subdirectory that contains its own `AGENTS.md`, treat the deepest `AGENTS.md` as a pointer to the relevant skill(s) for that scope.
