title: openai-serve (OpenAI-compatible gateway)
description: An OpenAI-compatible HTTP server that forwards requests to lcpd-grpcd (Requester) over gRPC.
---

`openai-serve` is a small HTTP gateway that implements a subset of the OpenAI API and forwards requests to a local
`lcpd-grpcd` (Requester) over gRPC. The Requester handles Lightning connectivity, quote/payment, and result retrieval.

This lets existing OpenAI-compatible clients (SDKs, LangChain, curl, etc.) send requests over LCP by mostly changing the
`base_url`.

## Architecture

```text
OpenAI SDK / curl
   |
   |  HTTP (OpenAI-compatible)
   v
openai-serve
   |
   |  gRPC (LCPDService)
   v
lcpd-grpcd (Requester)  --- Lightning --- Provider peer (lcpd-grpcd Provider)
```

Notes:

- `openai-serve` is intentionally stateless and does **not** connect to Lightning directly.
- The Requester (`lcpd-grpcd`) is the component that can spend sats.

## Supported endpoints (MVP)

- `POST /v1/chat/completions` (non-streaming only)
- `GET /v1/models`
- `GET /healthz`

## Quickstart

Prerequisite: run `lcpd-grpcd` separately (Requester mode) and ensure it can reach your Lightning node and LCP peers.

Build:

```sh
cd apps/openai-serve
go install ./cmd/openai-serve
```

Run:

```sh
export OPENAI_SERVE_HTTP_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8080"
export OPENAI_SERVE_LCPD_GRPC_ADDR="127.0.0.1:50051"

# Optional auth (comma-separated)
export OPENAI_SERVE_API_KEYS="devkey1"

openai-serve
```

Test:

```sh
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer devkey1' \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.2",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Say hello in Japanese."}]
  }'
```

## Using from CLI tools

`openai-serve` speaks the OpenAI **Chat Completions** API (non-streaming). Many OpenAI-compatible CLI tools can be
pointed at it by configuring a custom `base_url` and API key.

### Codex CLI

Configure Codex CLI to use `openai-serve` as a custom model provider (Chat Completions wire format):

1) Add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[model_providers.openai_serve]
name = "openai-serve"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_SERVE_API_KEY"
wire_api = "chat"

[profiles.lcp]
model = "gpt-5.2"
model_provider = "openai_serve"
```

2) Run (API key must match what `openai-serve` expects):

```sh
export OPENAI_SERVE_API_KEY="devkey1"
codex --profile lcp "Say hello in Japanese."
```

Note: `openai-serve` currently supports a strict subset of Chat Completions. If your client sends `tools`,
`response_format`, or streaming-related fields, the request will be rejected.

### LLM (`llm`)

`llm` can use an OpenAI-compatible base URL by defining an extra model. Create an `extra-openai-models.yaml` file in the
`llm` user directory and add:

```yaml
- model_id: lcp-gpt-5.2
  model_name: gpt-5.2
  api_base: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
  can_stream: false
  api_key_name: openai-serve
```

Then:

```sh
llm keys set openai-serve
llm --no-stream -m lcp-gpt-5.2 "Say hello in Japanese."
```

## Request/response behavior

- JSON decoding is strict (`DisallowUnknownFields`): unknown request fields are rejected with `400`.
- Request body size is limited to 1 MiB.
- Provider result bytes must be UTF-8 (non-UTF-8 results return `502`).
- Token usage in responses is approximate (bytes/4 heuristic).

For configuration, routing rules, and safety knobs (max price, timeouts, model allowlists), see
[Configuration](configuration).

## LCP metadata headers

`POST /v1/chat/completions` responses include:

- `X-Lcp-Peer-Id`: chosen Provider peer id
- `X-Lcp-Job-Id`: job id (hex)
- `X-Lcp-Price-Msat`: accepted quote price
- `X-Lcp-Terms-Hash`: accepted quote terms hash (hex)
